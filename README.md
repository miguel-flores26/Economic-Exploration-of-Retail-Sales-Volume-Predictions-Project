# Economic Exploration of Retail Sales Volume Predictions Project
 
This is a collaboration project worked on by myself and a peer of mine for an upper division statistics course at UC Davis. It studies the predictive influence of various economic factors in determining sales volume for a retail company given their store data. We use various machine learning methods including linear regression, cross-validation, principal component analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and confusion matrix validation.
